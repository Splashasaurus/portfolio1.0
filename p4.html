      <h2>
        Design Process:
      </h2>
      <p>
        This clock keeps track of time bsaed on the changing of the seasons! As each season comes in, it's represented by the changing colors of the grass grown. As each color change happens, it represents the passing of time. I was struggling on which sketch to go off of. I spent some time with my friends outside which inspired this clock. I noticed how the passing of time can come through the smaller moments. As a result I thought about the grass and how its slow growth shows time passing despite its gradual process. That's how I came to focus on the idea of grass and seasonal changes.

      <h2>
         Reflection:
       </h2>
      <p>
      While working on designing this clock, I learned more about how if and else statements functioned as well as the use of variables and increasing values. It was rough understanding the foundations at first and how things linked together, but it all worked out.
