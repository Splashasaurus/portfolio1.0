<h2>
  Reflections:
</h2>
<p>
  I learned a lot. I struggled a lot. Mostly with transferring code and uploading files. It was satisfying watching everything come together in the end but frustrating trying to understand the code and what was going wrong. 
</p>

      <h2>
        Proposal:

       </h2>
      <p>
        I wanted to develop a game based on my own experiences with skateboarding. My plan was to add in an intro and narrative supplemented by the game play itself of the player learning how to skate. I wanted to use a simple point system and as the player obtained more points, they would unlock cutscenes and more information.
     </p>

      <h2>
        Final Thoughts:

       </h2>
      <p>
        It was rough. Really rough to make this. P5JS continually crashed and code/files wouldn't transfer or upload properly. Everything came together in the end and adding the final details like sound effects was pretty satisfying. In the future, I would like to go back and optimize the code as well as possibly add in more cut scenes, places, & tricks to change the way the point system & gameplay works.
