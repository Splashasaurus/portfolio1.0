This data portrait tracked the number of pictures I took in the past week and the types of pictures I took through the use of emoji representation.

<h2>
  Instructions:
</h2>
<p>
  The data portrait consists of different emojis representing the types of pictures I took this week. üì± represents a screenshot; üñºÔ∏è represents a artwork; üèûÔ∏è represents a landscape; and üßç represents other people. 
</p>

      <h2>
        Design Process:

       </h2>
      <p>
        I realized how many pictures I had on my phone's camera roll recently. That inspired my data portrait as I wanted to see what it was that I took pictures of and was interested in. The lists I kept are based on each day I kept track of the types of pictures I took. Starting with Tuesday and ending on Saturday, each list is made up of the four emojis mentioned above representing the types of photos in my phone.

      <h2>
        Reflection:

       </h2>
      <p>
        Through the process of tracking myself, I realized that the majority of the photos on my phone are screenshots and pictures of artwork I enjoy or am inspired by. Through the process of data visualization, it was possible to see the number of photos I took, but the photos themselves were lost in abstraction.
