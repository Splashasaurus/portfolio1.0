	My project's idea was to hide messages within a layer of randomized patterns that would only reveal itself with the specific placement of the mouse.

  Description Cont:
</h2>
<p>
  By randomizing the stroke and keeping the fill of the circle consistent with the color of the text, the user can view the message by increasing the value of the stroke to read the text.

         Reflection:

       </h2>
      <p>
        I was inspired by Decodelia, developed by Melanie Hoff, for this project. Playing on a similar idea of obstruction through noise, I focused on developing a pattern that would conceal the message unless the user found a specific X Y mouse position that would change the stroke size. As I designed my illusion and fine tuned it, I used a mix of trial and error and looked into other projects developed on P5JS for examples. This optical illusion could be deployed as a method to conceal and protect sensitive information, as the constraints could be altered and more complicated so that a user could only see the information if they entered in a password or solved a problem. It could be a part of an art exhibit or turned into an interactive piece that reveals information or imagery based on user responses.
