        Object Decription:
      </h2>

      <p>
         A plastic keychain of a girl with medium length red hair, black glasses and purple clothing, it had a hook on the top to attach to a bag. Her head is oversized compared to the rest of her body. She also only has eyes and glasses no mouth or nose.
      </p>

        Reflections
      </h2>
      <p>
        The language my partner used to describe the image gave me a good idea of the shapes and colors of the object. I struggled a bit with the specification of clothing and hair of the object but used my own interpretation in response. I tried to relate the description to things I had seen before to use as a reference for what the object may have looked like, focusing on the idea of keychains and small dolls. The detail of the oversized head with no nose or mouth reminded me of voodoo doll keychains which I used as my mental reference.
      </p>
      <p>
      	With an idea of the objects shape, I first began to use simple shapes to block out the base body of the object. With elipses and rectangles I could create the basic sillouhette. Later I went back in using more specific shapes such as quadrilaterals and traingles to develop the object, before finally using fills and other primitives to complete what was described.
      </p>
      <p> At first I tried interpreting the description as literally as possible, developing the object as it was pictured in my mind, but as I continued trying to learn how to use p5 and convert shapes from illustrator, I found myself having to simplify and abstract shapes. In the end I came out with an object that still had the overall description but wasn't as detailed as I initially visualized it to be.
