      <h2>
        Design Process:
      </h2>
      <p>
        While developing the sketch, I realized that I struggled a lot with creating shapes in p5js because I didn't know the exact X and Y coordinates to line shapes up. As a result, I searched for and imported in a grid that would allow me to see the x and y axis based on my mouse position. Through a mix of trial and error, curves, and functions, I slowly created the exquisite corpse. 
<p class="space3">
</p>

<p>
  My guy, Sam, was developed out of a personal craving for watermelon. His creation came from my desire to draw something related to horror. Thinking about how awful it'd be to suddenly turn into a food, Sam came into being.

It's not going so great on his end.</p>

Exquisite Corpse: Sam accepted his fate. While experimenting on himself, he opened a interdimensional wormhole that collided in on itself. He's in a sillier situation now, his conscious merged with Albert and the magician. They can't make out what's going on, overwhelmed by the constant noise of three simultaneous minds and thoughts. The only thing that they can come to a consensus on is revenge through whatever means necessary to revert themselves.

         Reflection:
       </h2>
      <p>
     I really like the drawing aspect of this project. Until I realized we had to make our drawings out of code. Overall this was pretty fun though, it challenged me to work with new shapes and functions to a point where I've become uncomfortably comfortable with curves and custom shape creation. I enjoyed being able to develop a character and a story behind their development. :)
